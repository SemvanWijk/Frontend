		<h1>McLaren Senna</h1>

		<h2>Challenge the impossible</h2>
		<h2>THE McLAREN SENNA IS THE PERSONIFICATION OF McLAREN'S DNA AT ITS MOST EXTREME, CREATING THE PUREST
			CONNECTION BETWEEN CAR AND DRIVER</h2>

		<h3>It is the fastest track-focused road hypercar we have ever built, and it will set the fastest lap times of
			any
			McLaren to date. That is what has driven us to build a track car that is unashamedly without compromise. One
			that is legalised for road use, but not sanitised to suit it. Nothing else matters but to deliver the most
			intense driving experience around a circuit.</h3>
		<h3>Inspired by one of McLaren's greatest racing drivers, the McLaren Senna is utterly dedicated to allowing the
			driver to be the best they can possibly be.</h3>

			<h4>PERFORMANCE</h4>

			<p>The McLaren Senna has a single-minded purpose. In the pursuit of the most rewarding and intuitive driving
				experience, pioneering active aerodynamics generate unprecedented levels of downforce. It is also the
				lightest
				vehicle we have built since the iconic F1, with our most powerful road car engine to date. This
				combination
				creates a staggering power-to-weight ratio of 668PS-per-tonne (659bhp). It is the most direct and
				responsive
				McLaren ever built, surpassing even the McLaren P1™ GTR, to create the purest connection with the
				driver.
				The
				McLaren Senna is a new track benchmark for McLaren. Our fastest track-focused road hypercar.</p>

			<h4>DESIGN</h4>
			<img src="images/Senna_side.jpeg" alt="Side of the McLAREN Senna">
			<p>The McLaren Senna is the ultimate distillation of the company’s ‘form follows function’ design mantra. To
				observe
				the detailed work that has gone into every aerodynamic element of the McLaren Senna is mesmerising. To
				experience it all working in unison is truly incredible. The resulting 800kg of downforce in Race mode
				at
				significantly less than maximum speed (155mph or 250km/h) is phenomenal, and the McLaren Senna creates,
				maintains and controls its aerodynamic performance to ensure the driver has the confidence to explore
				the
				limits
				such downforce unlocks.</p>

			<h4>INNOVATION</h4>
			<img src="images/Senna_zoom.jpeg" alt="Zoom in of the McLAREN Senna's door">
			<p>We think of the McLaren Senna as a race car – we have designed and built it to perform on the track first
				and
				foremost. The active aerodynamics are pioneering, and the unprecedented visibility achieved through the
				unique
				glazed doors gives the driver total confidence. Exhaustive, fearless engineering has led us to revaluate
				and
				reassess every component, no matter how small or insignificant, to maximise performance. We have used
				carbon
				fibre for the monocoque, the body and everywhere we need lightness, rigidity and strength – it is the
				reason
				the
				McLaren Senna is the lightest and fastest track-focused road vehicle McLaren Automotive has ever built.

			<p>800PS and 800Nm from a 4.0-litre twin-turbocharged V8, the most powerful internal combustion engine
				McLaren
				has
				ever built. 800kg of downforce made possible by pioneering active aerodynamics. The lightest McLaren
				since
				the
				iconic F1 with dry weight of under 1200kg. A power-to-weight ratio of 668PS-per-tonne (659bhp) that
				ensures
				it
				will set the fastest lap times of any McLaren road car to date. 0-124mph (0-200km/h) in 6.8 seconds and

			<h4>THE LEGEND</h4>
			<img src="images/Ayrton_senna.jpeg" alt="placeholder">
			<p>When Ayrton Senna arrived at McLaren in 1988 he was an outstanding young driver, but he wasn’t yet the
				complete
				champion he would become during his time with the team. At 28 years old he was starting his fifth season
				in
				Formula 1 with six wins under his belt; at McLaren he would convert all that promise into three World
				Drivers’
				Championships.</p>

			<h4>THE AYRTON SENNA INSTITUTE</h4>
			<img src="images/placeholder.jpeg" alt="placeholder">
			<p>Envisioned by Ayrton Senna before his untimely death, the charitable work of the Instituto Ayrton Senna
				(IAS)
				is
				a remarkable legacy for one of McLaren’s greatest racing drivers. Established in 1994 by his sister
				Viviane,
				six
				months after his fatal crash at the San Marino GP, the non-profit organisation now benefits up to 1.6
				million
				children and young people in Brazil. On the racetrack he was one of the greatest drivers of all time,
				but
				his
				off-track achievements are arguably even greater. Thanks to the provision of comprehensive education,
				the
				IAS
				prepares the youth of Brazil to live in the 21st century and build a better future. McLaren is immensely
				proud
				to support the IAS, and to honour Ayrton Senna’s legacy at the highest level of motorsport with our most
				track-focused road car ever.
